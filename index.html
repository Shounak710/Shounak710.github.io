  <h2> About Me</h2>
  
  <p> I am Shounak Kulkarni, a third year Civil Engineering Undergraduate student at IIT Bombay.</p> 
  <p> Currently, I am the Web Manager for the technical club of IIT Bombay. </p>
  <p> I love coding because I feel it is really awesome to create things that can facilitate the lives of people,just over my laptop! </p>
  <p> Another reason is that I love maths and logic, and hope to someday create something that'll be of worth in this world</p>
